### Basic Machine learning model for predicting housing price<br />
It's a machine learning model which predicts the price of houses in a city by analysing history datas of the selling of houses in the city. Here we trying basic machine learning
algorithms to predict the price of houses and different algorithms which will lead to an high accuarate model.
